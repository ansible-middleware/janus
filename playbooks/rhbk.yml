          ### Installing the Collection from Automation Hub

          Before using the collection, you need to setup Ansible Automation Hub as galaxy server; then install it via the CLI:

              ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.rhbk
      - placeholder: roles_paths
        content: |
          ### Included roles

          * [`rhbk`](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/rhbk/content/role/rhbk/): role for installing the service.
          * [`rhbk_realm`](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/rhbk/content/role/rhbk_realm/): role for configuring a realm, user federation(s), clients and users, in an installed service.

          ## Support

          redhat.rhbk collection v{{ galaxy_version | default('0.0.0-dev') }} is for [Technical Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview).
          If you have any issues or questions related to collection, please don't hesitate to contact us on <Ansible-middleware-core@redhat.com> or open an issue on
          <https://github.com/ansible-middleware/keycloak/issues> referring to the keycloak_quarkus role

          #### Downloading from the Customer Portal

          The `rhbk` role supports downloading and installing from the Red Hat Customer Portal using credentials associated to a service account. After having
          authenticated in the customer portal, navigate to the hybrid cloud console, and select the [services account tab](https://console.redhat.com/application-services/service-accounts)
          to create one, if needed. Client ID and Client Secret associated to the service account need to be provided to the collection using the following variables:
          ```
          rhn_username{{':'}} '<client_id>'
          rhn_password{{':'}} '<client_secret>'
          ```

          The downloaded product archive will be stored in the controller working directory, and then distributed to target nodes.

          * The below example playbook can install based on the defined variables (using most defaults).

          ```
          ---
          - name: Playbook for rhbk Hosts
            hosts: all

            roles:
              - redhat.rhbk.rhbk
          ```

          Both playbooks include the `rhbk` role, with different settings, as described in the following sections.

          For full service configuration details, refer to the [rhbk role README](/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/rhbk/content/role/rhbk/).
